# React

React is split up into different rendering layers. React-dom and React-native

# Prettier

Let this tool handle all of code styling for you

```
$ yarn add global prettier

```

Preview example in CLI

```
prettier --single-quote --print-width-120 ClientApp.jsx
```

Apply styles to file with --write

```
prettier --single-quote --print-width-120 --write ClientApp.jsx

# Webpack

At it's simplest, it packages several files to one file (combining and minifying)

# Babel

Transforms jsx and es6 to to plain javascript or vanilla js. plus much other things

# React Router
## Hash Router
<HashRouter> is a Higher Order component -- It doesn't rende anything itself out, it does routing and then the route will render a component
## Route
Takes attributes exact, path, component
exact has to match path exactly, : will make dynamic path
<Route path="/:language/search" component={Search} >
## Switch
Will only render one component, whatever it matches first
# key
need a unique key, don't use index b/c when the array is reordered the index will change.

This is used so react doesn't have to rerender everything, if you sort something it will only move the unique key

# Props
child gets what it gets, props are immutable

# state
-- untracked input -- react is not keeping track of state

a component can have it's own state, but only change it's own state.

must use es6 class component

each component is this state or props. You don't have to follow events that provide something. If the state looks like this, it will always look like this

# Jest

## Istanbul
Built in with Jest
